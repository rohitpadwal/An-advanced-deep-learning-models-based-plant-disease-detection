## 🌿 An Advanced Deep Learning Models Based Plant Disease Detection

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project addresses a critical challenge in agriculture: the **early detection of plant diseases**, which directly impacts crop yield and global food security. Farmers often struggle to identify diseases at early stages, leading to significant crop losses and economic setbacks.

To tackle this, I developed an **AI-powered plant disease detection system** using advanced deep learning techniques. The goal is to enable timely interventions and promote sustainable farming practices.
